# IMGVips

Low-level bindings for [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips). For better shooting to the leg.

Implements [VipsOperation](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/VipsOperation.html) builder, which allows you to call most
of the existing image operations in the library.

# Requirements

* [livips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) 8+ (a higher version is usually better)
* Go 1.13+ (should work on lower versions, but I did not check)
